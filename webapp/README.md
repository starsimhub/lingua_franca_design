# Webapp

A tool for viewing `examples` models side by side with their `vignettes` translations, with diff-style markup and highlighting.

## Purpose

Reading a translation next to its original is the fastest way to see whether the lingua franca is doing its job. This webapp makes that comparison the default view: pick a model, see the original framework code on the left and the lingua franca version on the right, with the correspondence between them made visible.

## Intended behavior

- **Model picker**: browse the corpus by framework, paradigm, or feature exercised
- **Side-by-side panes**: original (`examples`) on the left, translation (`vignettes`) on the right, with syntax highlighting for both languages
- **Diff-style markup**: highlight what corresponds, what was simplified, and what gets uglier
- **Aligned scrolling**: keep semantically corresponding regions in view together, rather than aligning by line number
- **Annotations**: surface the vignette's commentary inline, anchored to the relevant region
- **Results comparison**: where reference outputs exist, show the original's and the translation's results together
- **Scorecard**: for each model, lines of code and run time for the original and the translation, so the "no more lines, no more time" test is visible at a glance across the whole corpus

Because the two sides are different languages, a plain textual diff will not be meaningful. The alignment needs to come from the vignette declaring the correspondence between its blocks and the original's — worth settling on a format for that early, since it affects how vignettes are written.

## Status

A first version is part of the project's website, which is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) from the Markdown files in this repository:

- `build.py` reads each model's `meta.yaml`, original source, vignette, and vignette `README.md`, and writes the comparison page (`webapp/index.qmd`) and the scorecard (`_scorecard.md`). Quarto runs it before each render, so neither file is edited or committed.
- `_picker.html` is the script that shows one model at a time.
- The model picker, side-by-side panes, syntax highlighting, the vignette's notes, and the scorecard are done. Diff-style markup, aligned scrolling, anchored annotations, and the results comparison are not: they wait on a format for a vignette to declare which of its blocks corresponds to which of the original's.

To build the site, run `quarto render` in the root folder (it needs `sciris`), or `quarto preview` to see it while editing. A new model also needs its two `README.md` files added to the `render` and `sidebar` lists in `_quarto.yml`.

## Relationship to other folders

- Reads its content from `examples` and `vignettes`.
- Makes gaps in `design` visible by showing where translations lose or add meaning.
