# EpiModel: SIS on a dynamic network

A stochastic SIS epidemic among 500 people whose partnerships form and dissolve over time, for 500 time steps. This is the network example from EpiModel's own introduction: a statistical model of the network is estimated from target statistics, and the epidemic is then simulated over networks drawn from it.

## What it exercises

- A contact network defined by what it should look like (the number of partnerships, how many people have two or more, nobody with four or more) instead of by a rule for making it
- Partnerships with a duration: each lasts 50 time steps on average, so the network changes slowly
- A separate estimation step (`netest`) before any simulation, and diagnostics of the simulated networks against their targets
- Transmission along partnerships between a susceptible and an infectious person, with a probability per act and a number of acts per time step
- Recovery back to susceptible
- Many stochastic simulations, each on its own network

## Files

- `original/intro_sis.R`: the model, from the vignette (see below for what was left out)
- `reference.R`: runs the original, then repeats its simulation and writes the runs for `run.py`
- `run.py`: runs `reference.R` and writes `reference/`
- `reference/results.csv`: the mean and 5% to 95% range of 100 simulations at each time step (`s.num`, `i.num`, `si.flow`, `is.flow`, `edges`, `meandeg`, `concurrent`, `duration`, `prop.diss`)
- `reference/timing.json`: the time of one simulation
- `meta.yaml`: where it came from
- `LICENSE`: the upstream license (GPL-3)

`original/intro_sis.R` is the code of steps 1 to 3 of the "Network Model Pipeline" section of the vignette "Introduction to EpiModel" in EpiModel 2.6.2, word for word, as extracted in `doc/Intro.R` of the installed package. The two `plot(dx)` lines of step 2 are left out, as is everything after step 3 (plots, summaries, and a second example).

## The model

- **Population:** 500 nodes, closed (no births or deaths), one group, no attributes
- **Formation model:** `~edges + concurrent + degrange(from = 4)` with target statistics `c(175, 110, 0)`: 175 partnerships (a mean degree of 2 × 175 / 500 = 0.7), 110 nodes with two or more partners, and no node with four or more
- **Dissolution model:** `~offset(edges)` with `duration = 50`: every partnership ends with probability 1/50 = 0.02 per time step, whatever its age or its nodes (a dissolution coefficient of log(49) = 3.892)
- **Estimation:** `netest` with its defaults, which fits a static ERGM to the targets and then subtracts the dissolution coefficient from the `edges` coefficient to get the formation model of the dynamic network (the "edges dissolution approximation"). The fitted formation coefficients are about -11.5 for `edges`, 1.4 for `concurrent`, and minus infinity for `deg4+`
- **Epidemic parameters:** `inf.prob = 0.4` (per act), `act.rate = 2` (acts per partnership per time step), `rec.rate = 0.05` (per time step)
- **Initial conditions:** `i.num = 10` infectious nodes, chosen at random; the other 490 are susceptible
- **Time:** `nsteps = 500`. A time step has no unit. Step 1 is the initial state, and steps 2 to 500 are simulated, so the flows have 499 values
- **Simulations:** `nsims = 5` in the original; 100 for the reference results

### What happens in a time step

With `control.net(type = "SIS")` and its defaults, EpiModel 2.6.2 does the following, in this order:

1. **Network:** the partnerships of this time step are looked up. By default (`resimulate.network = FALSE`) the whole dynamic network, all 500 steps of it, is simulated once at the start of each simulation, before the epidemic; this is possible because nothing in the epidemic changes the network. Each simulation starts from its own draw of the static network.
2. **Infection:** for every partnership between a susceptible and an infectious node, the susceptible node is infected with probability `1 - (1 - inf.prob)^act.rate` = 1 - 0.6² = 0.64. A susceptible node with several infectious partners has one such draw for each.
3. **Recovery:** every infectious node, including those infected in this time step, recovers with probability `rec.rate` = 0.05. The rate is used as the probability as it is, not as `1 - exp(-rec.rate)`. The time spent infectious is therefore geometric with a mean of 20 time steps.
4. **Counts:** `s.num` and `i.num` are counted at the end of the time step, and `si.flow` and `is.flow` are the numbers infected and recovered during it.

## Results

- `s.num`, `i.num`: the numbers susceptible and infectious at the end of each time step
- `si.flow`, `is.flow`: new infections and recoveries in each time step (from step 2)
- `edges`, `meandeg`, `concurrent`: the number of partnerships, the mean degree, and the number of nodes with two or more partners at each time step, to compare with the targets of 175, 0.7, and 110
- `duration`: the mean age of the partnerships that exist at each time step, as EpiModel computes it for its duration diagnostic (a partnership that already exists at step 1 is given an age drawn from the geometric distribution it should have); the target is 50
- `prop.diss`: the proportion of partnerships that end at each time step; the target is 0.02

The mean of `i.num` rises from 10 to an endemic level of about 227 of 500 (45%) by step 200, with about 12 infections and 12 recoveries per step. Over the last 200 steps the network statistics average 177 partnerships, a mean degree of 0.71, 111 nodes with two or more partners, and a mean partnership age of 50.1 steps.

`reference.R` runs the original as it is, and then runs `netsim` again with the original's own `est`, `param`, `init`, and `control`, changing only `nsims` to 100, the number of cores, and `nwstats.formula` (to record `meandeg` as well as the formation terms). It uses `set.seed(1)` for these runs, so `run.py` writes the same results each time, whatever the number of cores, as long as there are at least two (with one core EpiModel runs the simulations in the main R session and draws its random numbers differently). Every run estimates the network again with the original's `set.seed(12345)`, so the fitted model is also the same each time.

## Timing

One simulation (`netsim` with `nsims = 1`) takes about 4 seconds. About 90% of that is R code that keeps the history of every node's status and looks up the current partnerships in the dynamic network object at every step; simulating the 500 steps of the network takes about 0.4 seconds. Estimating the network (`netest`) takes about 0.7 seconds and is done once, and the diagnostics (`netdx`, 5 networks) about 1.5 seconds. `run.py` takes about three minutes on 10 cores.

## Lines of model code

13, counting the lines of `intro_sis.R` that are not blank or comments, without `library(EpiModel)` and without the diagnostics line (`netdx`), which is not needed to define or run the model. No line is over 100 characters. With the diagnostics it would be 14.
