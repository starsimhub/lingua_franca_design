# epydemix: the first wave of COVID-19 in Massachusetts

An age-structured SEIR with deaths, in the population of Massachusetts (7.0 million people in nine age groups), from 23 February to 2 August 2020. Transmission is scaled each day by a contact reduction computed from Google mobility data and by a seasonal factor; deaths follow the infectious period with the age-specific infection fatality rate, after an Erlang-distributed delay. The model is calibrated by ABC-SMC to weekly deaths up to 31 May, and then projected to 2 August under three reopening scenarios. It is epydemix's seventh tutorial, "Modeling the first wave of COVID-19 in Massachusetts", and its most complete worked example.

## What it exercises

- A model written out compartment by compartment (nine compartments, eight transitions), not a predefined one
- Competing exits with age-specific rates (`mu*(1-IFR)` to recovery and `mu*IFR` towards death), with the IFR given per age group
- An Erlang delay to death written as a chain of four compartments (`D0` to `D4`), each left at the rate `4/Delta`
- A transmission rate that varies by day: the product of a value computed from R0 and the leading eigenvalue of the contact matrix, a seasonal cosine, and a contact reduction from mobility data (`beta*r`, two time series given as arrays of daily values)
- Initial conditions drawn at random for each run (`I0` split over the age groups by a multinomial draw, then halved into `E` and `I`)
- Mixing by the sum of four contact matrices (school, work, home, community), with the population and matrices loaded by name, and one-year age groups aggregated into nine
- Weekly totals of a flow (the transition from `D3` to `D4`), as the calibration target
- Calibration by ABC-SMC of four parameters (`R0`, `Delta`, `I0`, and `seasonality_min`), with priors, and the weighted mean absolute percentage error as the distance
- Projections from the posterior under scenarios that change the contact reduction after the calibration period
- A stochastic (chain-binomial) solver with a daily step

## Files

- `original/covid19.py`: code cells 2 to 13 of the tutorial notebook, unchanged (a script extracted from a notebook; the first cell installs packages on Colab, and the last is empty)
- `original/data/`: the weekly deaths (`MA_deaths.csv`) and the Google mobility report (`MA_google.csv`) the tutorial reads, copied from `tutorials/data/massachusetts_data` in the epydemix v1.4.0 repository
- `simulate.py`: runs the original in the epydemix environment, with the changes listed below, and prints the summary and timing as JSON
- `run.py`: calls `simulate.py` and writes `reference/` (it takes about two and a half minutes)
- `reference/results.csv`: everything is in days from the start of 23 February 2020 to the end of the day (or week) it describes, so the week ending 1 March is time 8:
    - `data_deaths`: the weekly deaths the model is fitted to and projected against
    - `posterior_<par>`: the mean and the 5% to 95% range of the ABC-SMC posterior of `R0`, `Delta`, `I0`, and `seasonality_min` (at time 0)
    - `abc_fit_deaths`, and `abc_<scenario>_deaths` for the scenarios `persistence`, `moderate`, and `high`: the mean and 5% to 95% range of the weekly deaths of the accepted particles, and of 100 projections from the posterior
    - `fixed_<scenario>_deaths`: weekly deaths from 200 runs at fixed parameter values (the posterior medians, rounded: `R0` 2.22, `Delta` 20, `I0` 4,260, `seasonality_min` 0.8), for each scenario; for `persistence` also `fixed_persistence_deaths_<group>` by age group, and the daily totals of `S`, `E`, `I`, `R`, `D` (the sum of `D0` to `D3`), and `D4` (the dead)
- `reference/population.json`: the inputs that come from the data rather than the script (the size of each age group and the four contact matrices), the contact reduction in each scenario, the fixed parameter values, and the settings of the run
- `reference/timing.json`: the time of one run of `simulate_wrapper()`, the function the calibration evaluates
- `meta.yaml`: where it came from
- `LICENSE`: the license of epydemix (GPL-3.0)

## The model

- **Compartments:** `S`, `E`, `I`, `R`, and `D0` to `D4`, each split into the age groups 0-9, 10-19, ..., 70-79, and 80+
- **Infection:** a susceptible person in group `i` is infected at the rate `beta(t) * r(t) * sum_j C[i,j] * I[j] / N[j]`, where `C` is the sum of the four contact matrices and `N[j]` the size of group `j`
- **Transmission rate:** `beta(t) = R0 * mu / max eigenvalue(C) * s(t)`, where `s(t) = 0.5 * ((1 - smin) * cos(2π(t - 15 January)/365) + 1 + smin)` is 1 in mid-January and `smin` in mid-July
- **Contact reduction:** `r(t) = (1 + m(t)/100)²`, where `m(t)` is the mean of five of the mobility report's percentage changes (retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplaces, and residential) on day `t`; after 31 May it is held at its last value (persistence), or at 1.3 or 1.5 times it (moderate and high reopening)
- **Progression:** `E` to `I` at the rate `eps = 1/4` per day; `I` to `R` at `mu * (1 - IFR)` and to `D0` at `mu * IFR`, with `mu = 1/2.5` per day and the IFR from 0.00161% (0-9) to 7.8% (80+); `D0` to `D1` to ... `D4` each at `4/Delta`, so the time from leaving `I` to death is Erlang with four stages and mean `Delta`
- **Initial conditions:** `I0` infected people, split over the age groups by a multinomial draw in proportion to their size; half of each group's number (rounded down) start in `E` and half in `I`, and the rest of the group in `S` (so with an odd number, one person is in no compartment, although `N` still counts them)
- **Observed:** the weekly number moving from `D3` to `D4`, in weeks ending on Sundays (the first "week" is 23 February alone)
- **Calibration:** ABC-SMC with the priors `R0` ~ uniform(1.5, 6), `Delta` ~ integer uniform(7, 27), `I0` ~ integer uniform(10, 9999), `seasonality_min` ~ uniform(0.6, 1), and the distance `wmape = sum|observed - simulated| / sum|observed|`, over the 15 weeks to 31 May
- **Population:** 709,143, 834,913, 956,760, 973,053, 848,593, 911,402, 891,584, 582,877, and 293,074 people in the nine groups (7,001,399 in all)
- **Solver:** chain-binomial with a step of one day: each day the number leaving a compartment in a group is a multinomial draw, with the probability `1 - exp(-rate)` of leaving, split between the destinations in proportion to their rates

## Changes needed to run it

`simulate.py` makes three changes from outside, without editing the original:

- **The population's name.** The tutorial loads `"United_States_Massachusetts"`, which epydemix 1.4.0 rejects: in the data release it uses (epydemix-data v1.2.0) the name is `"United_States__Massachusetts"`, with a double underscore between the levels of the hierarchy. The tutorial as published does not run with the version it was published with.
- **The data.** The tutorial reads the deaths and mobility data from the `main` branch on GitHub; here they are read from the copies in `original/data`, taken from the v1.4.0 tag.
- **A smaller calibration.** The tutorial runs ABC-SMC with 1,000 particles for 10 generations, which took over an hour in the notebook's own output. Here it is 200 particles for 5 generations, which takes 87 s, seeded (`ABCSampler(rng=1)`, and `np.random.seed(1)` for the initial conditions). The posterior is therefore wider than the tutorial's, and the reference results of the calibration are for this smaller run.

Because the posterior of a small ABC-SMC run is itself noisy, the results that a translation is held to are the runs at fixed parameter values (`fixed_*`): the same model, the same inputs, and 200 runs, without the calibration. The calibration (`posterior_*`, `abc_*`) is kept to compare a translation's calibration with, more loosely.

## Data

The population and contact matrices are downloaded when the model runs, from [epydemix-data](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix-data) at the tag `v1.2.0`, so `run.py` needs a network connection. What was downloaded is recorded in `reference/population.json`. The contact matrices are from the primary source the data release lists for Massachusetts.

## Lines of model code

161: the 150 lines of `covid19.py` that are not blank, a comment, a docstring, an import, a `print` call, or plotting, with the eleven lines over 100 characters counted twice. This counts the loading of the data (the population takes 14 lines, as the age groups are listed one per line) and the calibration and projections, which are the point of the tutorial. The notebook is formatted with one item per line, which accounts for perhaps a third of the count.
