# Pandemics, macroeconomics, and modeling frameworks

Most of the costing reviewed elsewhere in this folder is health-sector costing: a unit cost per test, dose, or treatment course, plus DALYs or QALYs for the health effect. Pandemic modeling is different. When the intervention is closing schools or a third of the economy, the dominant costs are lost output, lost schooling, and the monetary value of lives lost, and they are counted in trillions rather than millions. The models that handle this couple an epidemic model to a (usually very simple) model of the economy, and some of them let the economy feed back into transmission. Part 1 of this page reviews five exemplars of that kind. Part 2 asks the narrower question that matters most for Starsim v4: of the general epi frameworks reviewed in [approaches/](../approaches/README.md), which support costs and health economic outputs at all, and how. Definitions of DALYs, QALYs, VSL, net monetary benefit (NMB), and related terms are in [metrics.md](metrics.md); general-purpose cost-effectiveness software is in [cea-software.md](cea-software.md).

## DAEDALUS

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Directly transmitted respiratory pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, pandemic influenza, and others in a built-in pathogen library) | Deterministic compartmental (age × economic sector × vaccination strata), continuous time | R, with a C++ core on [dust2](https://github.com/mrc-ide/dust2) | [jameel-institute/daedalus](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus) (v0.3.9; companion [daedalus.data](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus.data) and [daedalus.compare](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus.compare)) | Haw et al. (2022), [Optimizing social and economic activity while containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using DAEDALUS](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-022-00233-0), *Nature Computational Science* 2:223–233 |

DAEDALUS is the cleanest public example of an integrated epidemic–economy model. The population is split into four age groups plus 45 economic sectors of working adults (49 age-sector classes in the package; the original paper used 63 UK sectors), each sector with its own contact rates and its own gross value added (GVA). Closing a sector reduces both its workers' contacts and its output, so the same "openness" coefficient drives the epidemiology and the economics.

- **What is costed.** Three domains, all converted to US dollars: (1) **economic** losses, as lost GVA by sector, split into losses from mandated closures and losses from illness-related absence (symptomatic, hospitalized, and dead workers); (2) **education** losses, as school days lost multiplied by a value of a school day derived from GNI per capita, the lifetime earnings return to a year of schooling, and the (partial) effectiveness of remote teaching; (3) **lives lost**, both as life years lost (deaths × life expectancy by age) and as value of life lost (deaths × age-specific VSL). A separate `get_fiscal_costs()` computes government-side costs: economic support, vaccine doses, NPI implementation, interest, and tax revenue, as a public-debt trajectory.
- **How costs attach to the model.** Post hoc. `daedalus()` returns a `<daedalus_output>` with compartment trajectories and the NPI timing and openness actually used; `get_costs()` turns those into costs. Closures are endogenous (they can be triggered by a hospital-occupancy threshold), so the costs depend on the simulated epidemic, but the cost calculation itself does not feed back into the run. Notably, `get_costs()` also has a `data.frame` method that takes compartment names, sector workforce, daily GVA, VSL, and so on as arguments, so it can be applied to the output of a different epidemic model, which is a rare example of a standalone, model-agnostic macroeconomic costing function.
- **Health outcomes.** Deaths and hospitalizations by age; life years lost; VSL-valued mortality. There are no DALYs or QALYs, and morbidity in survivors is valued only through lost work.
- **Analyses supported.** Scenario comparison of response strategies (`"none"`, `"elimination"`, `"economic_closures"`, `"school_closures"`), timed versus threshold-triggered responses, vaccination investment scenarios, parameter uncertainty, and fiscal impact. The original 2022 paper optimized sector-by-sector closure configurations to maximize GDP subject to hospital capacity; its abstract describes the economic model as "reflecting sectoral heterogeneity in transmission and complex supply chains". The current R package's cost function, as read, values each sector's lost output independently from its GVA, with no input-output propagation between sectors.
- **Example.** From [`R/costs.R`](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus/blob/152b06bf6405aa35de86895b1d2109b7e2cd003b/R/costs.R#L84-L100), absences and deaths:

  ```r
  sector_cost_absences <- worker_prod_loss %*% diag(gva / workforce)
  ```

  ```r
  life_years_lost <- x$country$life_expectancy * total_deaths

  # NOTE: in million $s
  life_value_lost <- x$country$vsl * total_deaths / 1e6
  ```

  and [closures and education](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus/blob/152b06bf6405aa35de86895b1d2109b7e2cd003b/R/costs.R#L134-L140):

  ```r
      sector_cost_closures <- gva * sector_closures
      economic_cost_closures <- sum(sector_cost_closures)

      education_cost_closures <- vsd *
        n_students *
        sector_closures[i_EDUCATION_SECTOR] *
        (1 - EDU_EFFECTIVENESS_REMOTE)
  ```

  The user-facing call, from the [pandemic costs vignette](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus/blob/152b06bf6405aa35de86895b1d2109b7e2cd003b/vignettes/pandemic_costs.Rmd), is one line per scenario: `cost_list <- lapply(output_list, get_costs, summarise_as = "domain")`.
- **Strengths and limitations.**
  - One parameter (sector openness) is used consistently on both sides of the model, so the epidemiological benefit and the economic cost of a closure are not separately assumed.
  - Countries are data: switching `country = "United Kingdom"` to another ISO code swaps demography, contact matrices, sector GVA, workforce, VSL, and GNI together from `daedalus.data`.
  - Domains are reported separately (`summarise_as = "domain"`), which avoids forcing a single exchange rate between GDP and lives on the user, though `total_cost` does add them.
  - The economy is static, with no recovery dynamics, behavior-driven demand loss, or inter-sector linkages in the current package, and the education valuation rests on a handful of constants (for example `EDU_EFFECTIVENESS_REMOTE <- 0.33`, `EDU_ANNUAL_ROR <- 0.08` in [`R/constants.R`](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus/blob/152b06bf6405aa35de86895b1d2109b7e2cd003b/R/constants.R)).

## Pandemic preparedness investment cases

| Disease(s) | Paradigm | Language | Code | Key papers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "SARS-X" (novel SARS-like pathogens); pandemic influenza | Stochastic pandemic-occurrence model over many DAEDALUS-style epidemic runs; static expected-loss calculation | MATLAB (epidemic runs), R (costing and aggregation) | [robj411/p2_drivers](https://github.com/robj411/p2_drivers) | Model description in the repository README ("Costs and impacts of vaccine preparedness investments for SARS-X pandemics"); Fan, Jamison & Summers (2018), [Pandemic risk: how large are the expected losses?](https://doi.org/10.2471/BLT.17.199588), *Bull WHO* 96:129–134 |

Investment cases for pandemic preparedness ask a different question from outbreak response: what is the expected value, over an uncertain future stream of pandemics, of paying now for vaccine R&D, manufacturing capacity, or surveillance? Two exemplars bracket the approach.

**Fan, Jamison & Summers (2018)** is the static end. It fits an exceedance probability function for influenza pandemics of different severity and computes expected annual losses as the probability-weighted sum of income loss plus the "valuation of the lives lost", using a VSL. Its headline is about 720,000 expected pandemic deaths a year and expected annual losses of about US$500 billion, 0.6% of global income, ranging from a little over 0.3% of national income in high-income countries to 1.6% in lower-middle-income countries, with most of the expected loss coming from rare severe events (figures from the [abstract](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-37c8-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)). There is no transmission model and no code; it is included because "expected annual loss" is the quantity every later preparedness case is anchored to.

**`p2_drivers`** is the simulation end, and the repository cited by DAEDALUS's README as its other parent. It samples pandemics (pathogen parameters, country, timing), runs a DAEDALUS-type sectoral epidemic model for each under different vaccine-preparedness investments (a broadly protective "BPSV" stockpile, reserved "SSV" manufacturing capacity, enabling activities), and combines epidemic outcomes with a separate **costing model** for the investments themselves.

- **What is costed.** Societal losses from each epidemic (life years, GDP, school years, valued in dollars) and, separately, preparedness and response costs: risk-adjusted R&D cost per candidate (using phase-by-phase probabilities of success), procurement, delivery, and capacity reservation, by country income level.
- **How costs attach to the model.** Post hoc on each epidemic run (`p2Cost.m`), then aggregated over the sampled pandemic distribution in R. Investment costs are computed in a separate model ([`code/costing/`](https://github.com/robj411/p2_drivers/tree/51deebbabeca12b2df03567bc9d57dcd5a6634f6/code/costing)) whose outputs (vaccine delivery profiles) are also inputs to the epidemic runs.
- **Health outcomes.** Deaths, converted to life years lost using GBD remaining life expectancy weighted by the age distribution of deaths, then valued with a value of a life year (VLY) back-calculated from the VSL.
- **Analyses supported.** Expected societal loss averted per dollar of preparedness investment, by investment type and country income group, with probabilistic sampling of pathogen, country, and cost parameters.
- **Example.** The loss function, from the [README](https://github.com/robj411/p2_drivers/blob/51deebbabeca12b2df03567bc9d57dcd5a6634f6/README.md#1-societal-losses):

  $$\text{TSL} = K_1\text{VLY} + K_2 + K_3\text{VSY}$$

  "where $K_1$ is the number of life years lost and VLY the value of a life year; $K_2$ is the sum of lost GDP over the period due to reduced economic activity of sectors; and $K_3$ is the number of school years lost and VSY the value of one school year." The VLY is defined from the VSL as a population-weighted average, $\text{VSL}=\frac{\sum_g\tilde{N}_gl_g^{\text{(life)}}}{\sum_g\tilde{N}_g}\text{VLY}$. In code, from [`p2Cost.m`](https://github.com/robj411/p2_drivers/blob/51deebbabeca12b2df03567bc9d57dcd5a6634f6/code/functions/p2Cost.m#L37-L46):

  ```matlab
  %% value of life lost

  deaths    = deathmat;
  costs.deaths = deaths(end,:);

  lyl       = deaths(end,:).*data.yll;
  costs.life_years = lyl;

  vlyl      = lyl*data.vly;
  costs.value_YLL = vlyl;
  ```
- **Strengths and limitations.**
  - The only public exemplar found that separates the cost of *interventions* (R&D pipelines with attrition, capacity reservation, delivery) from the *losses* they avert, and models both stochastically.
  - Valuing deaths by remaining life years (rather than a flat VSL per death) makes the age profile of mortality matter, which it should for respiratory pandemics.
  - It is a research codebase (MATLAB plus R scripts), not a library; reuse means reading the README as a specification.
  - The local `PandemicPreparednessValuation23` repository is not public on GitHub (the URL returns 404), so it is not reviewed here.

## SIR-macro (Eichenbaum, Rebelo & Trabandt)

| Disease(s) | Paradigm | Language | Code | Key papers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COVID-19 (generic SIR-type epidemic) | Deterministic SIRD embedded in a dynamic general-equilibrium macroeconomic model; optimal policy | MATLAB | Replication code from the authors' sites ([tinyurl.com/ERTcode](https://tinyurl.com/ERTcode), which resolves to a zip on Mathias Trabandt's site); not on GitHub | Eichenbaum, Rebelo & Trabandt (2021), [The Macroeconomics of Epidemics](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26882), *Review of Financial Studies* 34(11):5149–5187 (NBER WP 26882, 2020) |

This is the canonical economist's epi-economic model and the opposite design from DAEDALUS: the epidemiology is minimal, and the economics is a full optimizing model in which people choose how much to consume and work. Because consumption and work are where people meet, those choices set the infection rate, and the infection rate feeds back into the choices. There are hundreds of follow-on "SIR-macro" papers.

- **What is costed.** Lost consumption (the recession) and lost lives, both in units of household welfare (lifetime discounted utility), not as separately reported dollar totals.
- **How costs attach to the model.** During simulation, and in fact inseparably: there is no costing step. Containment is modeled as a tax on consumption, and the planner chooses its path to maximize welfare, so the "cost of the lockdown" and the "value of deaths averted" are both terms of one objective.
- **Health outcomes.** Deaths only. The value of a life is not an input: it is the discounted utility of the remaining life of a representative person, and the authors calibrate the discount factor so that it equals "9.3 million 2019 dollars", "consistent with the economic value of life used by U.S. government agencies" (with a sensitivity case at 6.1 million).
- **Analyses supported.** Competitive equilibrium versus optimal containment; effects of delaying or ending containment early; vaccines and treatments arriving at random times; capacity-constrained health care.
- **Example.** The transmission function, from the [NBER working paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26882/w26882.pdf) (Section 2.2), has one term per place people meet:

  $$T_t = \pi_1 (S_t C_t^s)(I_t C_t^i) + \pi_2 (S_t N_t^s)(I_t N_t^i) + \pi_3 S_t I_t$$

  where $C_t^s, C_t^i$ are consumption and $N_t^s, N_t^i$ hours worked by susceptible and infected people. The paper describes these as the three ways susceptible people can become infected: while purchasing consumption goods, at work, and through other contacts.
- **Strengths and limitations.**
  - The only exemplar here where economic behavior is endogenous to the epidemic and vice versa, which is why it predicts a recession even without mandates (people cut consumption voluntarily).
  - Costs and benefits are commensurate by construction, which makes optimal-policy questions well posed.
  - The epidemiology is a single homogeneous SIR; no age structure, no heterogeneity in contacts, which limits its use for vaccine allocation or school policy.
  - Outputs are in welfare units and are hard to compare with a health-sector CEA.

## LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 vaccine valuation (covidm)

| Disease(s) | Paradigm | Language | Code | Key papers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COVID-19 | Age-structured deterministic/stochastic compartmental (covidm), with a separate economic model | C++/R (covidm) | covidm is described as available on the CMMID GitHub; public repositories include [nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha](https://github.com/nicholasdavies/covidm-alpha) and [cmmid/covid-uk](https://github.com/cmmid/covid-uk). The economic layer of the paper below does not appear to be public. | Sandmann et al. (2021), [The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00079-7), *Lancet Infect Dis* ([PMC full text](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972313/)) |

This is the exemplar of conventional health-economic evaluation (QALYs, a threshold, discounting, PSA) applied to a pandemic, extended with a crude macroeconomic perspective. It sits between the health-sector CEA tradition and DAEDALUS.

- **What is costed.** Two perspectives. From the NHS perspective: hospital and other health care costs, and vaccine doses ("a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15"). From a wider societal perspective: GDP losses from physical distancing, assumed at "2% of daily GDP (ie, around £115·1 million) for each day COVID-19 incidence exceeded 1000 new reported cases", with 2–15% explored for mandated distancing. Health-sector costs and patient productivity losses are not added to GDP losses, "to avoid double counting".
- **How costs attach to the model.** Post hoc: the transmission model produces cases, admissions, ICU stays, deaths, and days of distancing by scenario, and a separate economic model applies unit costs, QALY losses, and the GDP rule, with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis over the economic parameters.
- **Health outcomes.** QALYs lost by symptomatic cases, non-fatal admissions, ICU survivors, long COVID, adverse events following immunization, and premature deaths, discounted at 3.5% a year, valued at £20,000 per QALY.
- **Analyses supported.** Net monetary value of vaccination scenarios over 10 years, under several distancing regimes, vaccine efficacies, and durations of protection; sensitivity to the discount rate (0–10%) and GDP-loss assumptions.
- **Example.** From the abstract: "We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) – costs."
- **Strengths and limitations.**
  - Standard, reference-case-compatible metrics (QALYs, NMB, 3.5% discounting), so results are comparable with other UK appraisals.
  - The GDP perspective is an explicit threshold rule rather than a model of the economy; it makes the macroeconomic cost visible but crude.
  - The explicit decision to keep NHS costs and GDP losses in separate perspectives is a good pattern for any library: perspectives are different sums, not one total.
  - Thunström et al. (2020), [The benefits and costs of using social distancing to flatten the curve for COVID-19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242774/), *J Benefit-Cost Anal* 11(2):179–195, is the parallel US exemplar on the VSL side: lives saved by distancing, valued with a VSL, against GDP losses, with a benchmark net benefit of about $5.2 trillion.

## PTTI (population-wide testing, tracing, and isolation)

| Disease(s) | Paradigm | Language | Code | Key papers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COVID-19 | SEIR-TTI ODE (primary), plus agent-based, network ([EoN](../approaches/eon.md)), and Kappa rule-based variants of the same model | Python | [ptti/ptti](https://github.com/ptti/ptti) (archived on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4298798)) | Sturniolo et al. (2021), [Testing, tracing and isolation in compartmental models](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008633), *PLOS Comput Biol*; Colbourn et al. (2020), Modelling the health and economic impacts of population-wide testing, contact tracing and isolation (PTTI) strategies for COVID-19 in the UK, SSRN working paper ([UCL record](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10128778/)) |

PTTI is the best public example found of operational costing of a test-trace-isolate program inside an epidemic model: not a cost per test, but how many tracers, supervisors, and labs a given trajectory requires, with hiring and contract-length rules.

- **What is costed.** Contact tracing (tracers, supervisors, team leads, hiring costs, a tracing app, public communications); testing (laboratory startup and staffing, sized to peak testing demand within each contract block, plus a cost per PCR test); NHS treatment costs per recovered case; and GDP loss, scaled by how far contact rates are below normal and by the fraction of the population in isolation.
- **How costs attach to the model.** Post hoc, but on the full trajectory. `calcArgumentsODE()` reads daily compartment sizes and time-varying parameters (testing rate `theta`, contacts `c`, tracing success `chi`) from a run and derives daily tests, traces, and isolations; `calcEconOutputs()` turns those into costs. Capacity is "ratcheted": tracers and labs, once hired, are paid until the end of their contract block.
- **Health outcomes.** Deaths, ICU and hospital admissions, and cases, derived from cumulative recoveries using fixed fractions. No QALYs or DALYs.
- **Analyses supported.** Comparison of 31 UK scenarios combining lockdown, testing, tracing, and face coverings, reporting deaths, program cost, and GDP loss side by side (the working paper's best scenario had about 52,000 deaths, about £8 billion intervention cost, and about £500 billion GDP loss, according to the [UCL news release](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/jun/urgent-testing-tracing-and-isolation-could-save-lives-and-economy)).
- **Example.** GDP as a function of contacts and isolation, from [`ptti/economic.py`](https://github.com/ptti/ptti/blob/f179763f9afdc903ff3ee2b355cda56be0af86b2/ptti/economic.py#L186-L199):

  ```python
      # Economy Scales with contacts
      # Economy minimum is: econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Shutdown_GDP_Penalty'], with econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Shutdown_Contacts']
      # Full strength is 0 penalty at econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Open_Contacts']
      Daily_GDP = []
      Daily_GDP_Base = econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_GDP_Monthly'] / 30
      Isolated_Fraction = isolated / population # Each person in isolation is a fraction of the economy fully closed.
      # print(Isolated_Fraction)

      Shutdown_Fraction = 1 - (contacts-econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Shutdown_Contacts'])/(
          econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Open_Contacts'] - econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Shutdown_Contacts'])

      Daily_GDP = (1 - Shutdown_Fraction *
                   econ_inputs['Shutdown']['UK_Shutdown_GDP_Penalty'])*(1-Isolated_Fraction)*Daily_GDP_Base
      No_Pandemic_GDP = days * Daily_GDP_Base
  ```
- **Strengths and limitations.**
  - Costs depend on capacity, not just volume: a program has fixed, step, and variable costs, and the step costs are driven by the *peak* of the simulated demand. Almost no other disease model does this.
  - GDP loss is tied to the model's own contact-rate parameter, the same coupling idea as DAEDALUS openness, in one line.
  - The economic inputs are a single UK dictionary (`economic_data.py`) and the costing is written against the ODE model's compartment names, so it is not reusable without adaptation, even across PTTI's own model variants.
  - The repository has been inactive since November 2020.

Other candidates were checked and not given full entries. The Imperial [`squire`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire) and [`nimue`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/nimue) packages, widely used for COVID-19 vaccine impact, contain no costing code (searched for cost, QALY, DALY, and GDP); costing in that work was done downstream. Covasim has no built-in costing, and no public Covasim testing or tracing cost-effectiveness code was found in the IDM repositories checked. One Health and zoonotic spillover economic models were not found to have public code of comparable maturity, so they are omitted.

# Part 2: Costing and health economic outputs in general epi frameworks

The question here is not whether someone has ever done a cost-effectiveness analysis with a framework (people have, with nearly all of them), but whether the framework itself gives costs or DALYs/QALYs a place to live. The answer is mostly no. Where support exists, it takes one of four forms: a cost attribute on an intervention or product, tallied when it is delivered (EMOD, Starsim v4, STIsim); an analyzer or observer that accumulates person-time or events into YLL/YLD (HPVsim, Vivarium); a user-written module that does both every step (EpiModel's gallery example); or costs as a first-class optimization input (Atomica, and in a different sense MEmilio's optimal-control example).

## The Starsim family

**Starsim v3 (current release, 3.7.2)** has no cost or DALY machinery. A search of [`starsim/`](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/tree/main/starsim) for cost, DALY, QALY, YLL, and YLD finds only comments about computational cost. Costing in Starsim-based projects has been done with custom analyzers.

**Starsim v4 (the [`v4` branch](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/tree/v4), in development)** adds a per-delivery `cost` to every product. `ss.Vaccine`, `ss.Treatment`, and `ss.Test` all accept `cost=`, and the delivery interventions (`ss.vaccinate()`, `ss.treat()`, `ss.screen()`) add a `cost` result when their product has one. From [`starsim/products.py`](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/blob/8c10e9e5bf9b8b2ebfdb1fb103e14e202ea99631/starsim/products.py#L473-L478) (the `ss.Test` docstring):

````python
        cost (float): the cost of each delivery
        name (str): the name; if not given, taken from the variable the test is assigned to

    Examples:
        ```python
        pcr = ss.Test(sensitivity=0.9, specificity=0.98, cost=4.00, delay=ss.days(2))
````

and from [`starsim/interventions.py`](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/blob/8c10e9e5bf9b8b2ebfdb1fb103e14e202ea99631/starsim/interventions.py#L775-L785), the result is created only when a cost is given:

```python
    def init_results(self):
        super().init_results()
        abm = self.sim.solver == 'abm'
        results = [
            ss.Result('delivered', dtype=float, scale=abm, label='Number delivered', summarize_by='sum'),
            ss.Result('eligible', dtype=float, scale=abm, label='Number eligible', auto_plot=False),
            ss.Result('coverage', dtype=float, scale=False, label='Coverage of those eligible', auto_plot=False),
        ]
        if getattr(self.product, 'cost', None) is not None:
            results += [ss.Result('cost', dtype=float, scale=abm, label='Cost', summarize_by='sum')]
```

and is filled at delivery, using the same `tally()` as the delivered count ([`interventions.py#L1014-L1016`](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/blob/8c10e9e5bf9b8b2ebfdb1fb103e14e202ea99631/starsim/interventions.py#L1014-L1016)):

```python
        n = self.tally('delivered', chosen)
        if 'cost' in res:
            self.tally('cost', chosen, product.cost)
```

Two properties of this design are worth noting. First, because `tally()` also fills `res.strata` when the sim is stratified, costs come out by stratum (age, sex, risk group) for free, the same way disease results do. Second, the same code path runs whether the sim is agent-based or compartmental (`self.selector.abm`), so the cost result has the same meaning in both paradigms. What it does not do: costs are flat per delivery (no fixed, capacity, or per-person-time costs), there is no discounting or currency/year metadata, and there is no health-effect counterpart (no DALY or QALY result). [TBsim](https://github.com/starsimhub/tbsim) (on Starsim v4) passes `cost=` through its TB-specific tests, vaccines, and preventive therapy, for example in [`tbsim/interventions/care.py`](https://github.com/starsimhub/tbsim/blob/d3996bf4350d5b1968a7b9d09665a5b2ae8e6f7a/tbsim/interventions/care.py#L35): "kwargs (dict): passed to `ss.Test`, e.g. `cost=` or `delay=`".

**STIsim** has a [`logistics`](https://github.com/starsimhub/stisim/tree/f9af9e8be546a479db467a4360ecb06e38c5036d/stisim/logistics) subpackage that models finite supply, not just cost. A `Product` (name, `ProductCategory` such as `PREP` or `ART`, `DeliveryMode` such as `SHOT` or `PILL`, per-unit `cost`, and efficacy by time since delivery) is held in a `Supply` with a quantity (possibly `np.inf`), several supplies form a `Supplies` pool that can be shared across interventions, and an abstract `SuppliedIntervention` allocates limited stock across eligibility groups in proportion to their coverage gaps. Cost accrues when stock is used, from [`supply.py`](https://github.com/starsimhub/stisim/blob/f9af9e8be546a479db467a4360ecb06e38c5036d/stisim/logistics/supply.py#L36-L47):

```python
    def use(self, quantity):
        """uses a specified quantity of the product, returning the remaining quantity and cost of usage"""
        remaining = self.quantity - quantity
        if remaining < 0:
            raise self.InsufficientSupplyException(f"Attempted to use {quantity} {self.product.name}. "
                                                   f"Only {self.quantity} exists.")
        self.quantity = remaining

        cost = quantity * self.product.cost
        self.accrued_cost += cost

        return self.quantity, cost
```

Costs are tracked at two levels: `SuppliedIntervention.accrued_cost` (this intervention's own spend) and `Supplies.accrued_cost` (the pooled total across every intervention drawing on the shared stock), which is a real attribution choice made explicit. Limitations: `accrued_cost` is a running scalar rather than a time series result, so costs by year or by stratum are not recorded; `Product` is a separate class from `ss.Product` (a TODO in the source notes that they should be reconciled); and selection currently uses Python's `random.sample` rather than Starsim's common random numbers (also marked TODO).

**HPVsim** (now on Starsim) has a [`dalys` analyzer](https://github.com/starsimhub/hpvsim/blob/9037e7b211771b6dc9696509b684f973dd68e2eb/hpvsim/analyzers.py#L482-L575) computing incidence-based DALYs for cervical cancer: at each cancer onset it adds YLL (reference life expectancy minus age at the scheduled cancer death) and YLD (duration with cancer times a stage-weighted average disability weight, GBD 2017 by default), weighted by agent scale and multiplied by `pop_scale` at finalize. The core, from [`analyzers.py#L535-L541`](https://github.com/starsimhub/hpvsim/blob/9037e7b211771b6dc9696509b684f973dd68e2eb/hpvsim/analyzers.py#L535-L541):

```python
    def _accumulate(self, year, cancer_age, death_age, weight):
        if year < self.start_year or year > self.end_year:
            return
        idx = year - self.start_year
        dur = death_age - cancer_age
        self.yld[idx] += float((weight * dur * self.av_disutility).sum())
        years_left = np.maximum(0.0, self.life_expectancy - death_age)
        self.yll[idx] += float((weight * years_left).sum())
```

It reads the scheduled `ti_dead_cancer` at onset, so DALYs are attributed to the onset year even when the death falls after the simulation ends; there is no discounting and no cost counterpart. The cancer/NCD page covers HPVsim's health-economic analyses in more depth.

**FPsim, Covasim, Rotasim, RSVsim**: no cost, DALY, or QALY code was found in their main branches. **LASER** ([laser-core](https://github.com/laser-base/laser-core)): none found.

## Other frameworks

**EMOD** has the oldest built-in cost mechanism in this review. Every intervention has a `Cost_To_Consumer` parameter (with intervention-specific defaults, for example 3.75 for `RTSSVaccine` and 8.0 for `Ivermectin` in the [source](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/EMOD/tree/main/interventions)); when an intervention is distributed it notifies the node, which multiplies by the agent's Monte Carlo weight and accumulates a "Campaign Cost" channel in `InsetChart.json` (with units `"USD"` set in [`Report.cpp`](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/EMOD/blob/01f8b6f20522ede55da11c208e24ef5c5207bb38/Eradication/Report.cpp#L365)). From [`NodeEventContext.cpp`](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/EMOD/blob/01f8b6f20522ede55da11c208e24ef5c5207bb38/Eradication/NodeEventContext.cpp#L118-L130):

```cpp
    void NodeEventContextHost::notifyCampaignExpenseIncurred(float expenseIncurred, const IIndividualHumanEventContext * pIndiv)
    {
        release_assert( node );
        if( expenseIncurred > 0 )
        {
            LOG_DEBUG("Campaign expense was incurred\n");
        }
        float cost = expenseIncurred;
        if( pIndiv != nullptr )
        {
            cost *= float( pIndiv->GetMonteCarloWeight() );
        }
        IncrementCampaignCost( cost );
```

The schema's own description of the parameter is telling: "Setting Cost_To_Consumer to zero for all other interventions, and to a non-zero amount for one intervention, provides a convenient way to track the number of times the intervention has been applied in a simulation." In practice it was used at least as often as a delivery counter as for costing, since all interventions sum into one channel. EMOD has no DALY or QALY reporter (searched the [EMOD-Hub/EMOD](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/EMOD) source for DALY); burden was computed post hoc from event and age reports.

**EpiModel** has no costing in the core package, but the official [EpiModel Gallery](https://github.com/EpiModel/EpiModel-Gallery) includes a [cost-effectiveness example](https://github.com/EpiModel/EpiModel-Gallery/tree/5e4f50879f225a13a99a52932ce9b6d2d7f5f705/examples/cost-effectiveness): a custom module, run every step like any other EpiModel module, that adds state costs, state- and age-dependent QALYs, and amortized intervention costs, discounts them, and records them as epidemic outputs; the script then calls `dampack::calculate_icers()`. From [`module-fx.R#L40-L64`](https://github.com/EpiModel/EpiModel-Gallery/blob/5e4f50879f225a13a99a52932ce9b6d2d7f5f705/examples/cost-effectiveness/module-fx.R#L40-L64):

```r
  # Account for costs of each sub-population
  pop.sus.cost <- length(idsSus) * sus.cost
  pop.inf.cost <- length(idsInf) * inf.cost
```

```r
  # Discount aggregated costs and effects
  t <- at - cea.start
  pop.cost.disc <- pop.cost * 1 / (1 + disc.rate) ^ (t / 52)
  pop.qaly.disc <- pop.qaly * 1 / (1 + disc.rate) ^ (t / 52)
```

This is the "state-cost" pattern from the CEA software world (cost and utility per person-time in a state) implemented as a simulation module. Note the hard-coded `/ 52` weekly time step.

**Vivarium** ([vivarium_public_health](https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_public_health)) has burden built in, as one would expect from IHME: a `MortalityObserver` that records cause-specific deaths and YLLs, and a `DisabilityObserver` that records YLDs from a `disability_weight` value pipeline to which each disease state contributes, both stratifiable. There is no cost machinery in the package; the cancer/NCD page covers Vivarium simulations that add costs.

**Atomica** is the one framework in the review where cost is a first-class input to the model rather than an output: programs in the `progbook` have unit costs, spending, and coverage functions, and `reconcile()` and the optimizers allocate a budget across programs to minimize an objective (see [atomica.md](../approaches/atomica.md); the HIV/optimization page covers it in depth). Burden metrics are user-defined framework parameters rather than built-in DALYs.

**OpenMalaria** has no cost or DALY output in its current source ([SwissTPH/openmalaria](https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria); the `cost` attributes in old schemas are fitness costs of drug-resistance mutations). It does emit the resource-use counts costing needs: survey measures such as `nTreatments1`, `nTreatDiagnostics`, `nMassITNs`, `nEPIVaccinations`, and `expectedDirectDeaths`, which published economic evaluations cost post hoc. The malaria page covers this further.

**MEmilio** has no general cost or burden output, but its [`ode_seair_optimization.cpp`](https://github.com/SciCompMod/memilio/blob/main/cpp/examples/ode_seair_optimization.cpp) example solves an optimal-control problem in which "the socioeconomic costs are to be minmized using an objective functional which is the weighted integral of the nonpharmazeutical interventions and testing costs", using IPOPT with automatic differentiation. Cost here is an abstract weight on control effort, not money.

**flepiMoP** has a well-developed declarative outcomes model ([flepimop.md](../approaches/flepimop.md): source × probability × delay × duration, chainable from infections to cases, hospitalizations, and deaths), which produces exactly the event and occupancy series a cost or DALY calculation needs, but no costs or burden metrics themselves (a search of [HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP) for cost finds only computational uses).

**odin/dust, summer2, epydemix, individual, epiworld, SimInf, EoN, EMULSION, epymorph, MetaCast, epipack, EpiHiper, camdl, epidemics**: no cost, DALY, or QALY support was found. odin/dust2 is nonetheless the engine under DAEDALUS, so the macroeconomic costing above is an example of what can be layered on an odin-family model.

## Cross-cutting patterns

- **Pandemic costing is dominated by things health-sector CEA leaves out.** In DAEDALUS, p2_drivers, PTTI, and the Sandmann analysis, GDP losses from closures dwarf treatment costs. A general library cannot assume "cost = unit cost × deliveries" is the whole story; it needs a way to cost *states of the world* (sector openness, contact reduction, isolation) per unit time, not just interventions per delivery.
- **The best epi-economic models use one parameter on both sides.** DAEDALUS sector openness, PTTI contact rates, and ERT consumption all drive transmission and output simultaneously. In Starsim terms this argues for interventions whose effect parameter (for example a network contact multiplier) is also a declared, recorded quantity that a cost function can read, rather than an opaque change buried in `step()`.
- **Post hoc costing is the norm, and that is fine if the trajectory carries enough.** Every Part 1 model except ERT computes costs after the run. What they need from the run is specific: person-time by state, age, and sector; events by age; the actual timing and level of each intervention; and peaks (for capacity costs). DAEDALUS's `get_costs.data.frame()` shows the endpoint: a costing function that needs only named outputs and is independent of the model that produced them.
- **Lives are valued in three incompatible ways.** VSL per death (DAEDALUS, Thunström), value of a life year times remaining life expectancy (p2_drivers), and QALYs at a threshold (Sandmann), plus the endogenous welfare value in ERT. A library should emit the ingredients (deaths by age and time, remaining life expectancy, person-time in states) and leave the valuation to configurable post-processing, as [metrics.md](metrics.md) argues.
- **Perspectives should be separate sums, not one total.** Sandmann keeps NHS costs and GDP losses apart to avoid double counting; DAEDALUS reports domains separately. A cost result should carry a perspective or category tag (health system, household, government, society) so totals are a choice, not a default.
- **Capacity and supply matter.** PTTI sizes labs and tracers to peak demand; STIsim's `Supplies` limits stock and allocates it by coverage gap; Atomica makes budget the constraint. Starsim v4 already has a `capacity` on delivery; pairing it with fixed and step costs would cover most of the PTTI pattern.
- **Starsim already has most of the building blocks.** Starsim v4 tallies per-delivery cost by stratum in both ABM and compartmental runs; STIsim adds finite supply and cost attribution across shared stock; HPVsim's `dalys` analyzer shows the incidence-based YLL/YLD pattern; and `ss.Result` with `summarize_by='sum'` and strata gives a natural home for both costs and DALYs. What is missing is shared, not disease-specific: discounting with a declared base year and currency, a generic burden analyzer (person-time in states × weights, deaths × remaining life expectancy), per-time costs on states, and the multi-sim plumbing for "averted" quantities with common random numbers.
- **Built-in cost channels get used as counters.** EMOD's single "Campaign Cost" channel was often used to count deliveries. Starsim v4's separate `delivered` and `cost` results avoid that trap; keeping costs per intervention, per product, and per stratum (rather than summed into one channel) is what makes them usable.
- **Macroeconomic models are a different layer, not a different engine.** DAEDALUS runs on dust2 and its economics is a few hundred lines of R over the trajectory. A Starsim-family equivalent would be an analyzer plus country data (sector GVA, workforce, VSL, GNI), attached to a network or mixing-pool model with sectors as strata, rather than a new kind of simulation.
